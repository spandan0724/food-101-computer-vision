# Food 101 Computer Vision Project



## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a computer vision project focused on classifying food images using the Food 101 dataset. The goal of this project is to surpass the accuracy reported in the Food 101 research paper by leveraging transfer learning with EfficientNetB0, implementing prefetching for faster data processing, and utilizing data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting.

## Dataset

The [Food 101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) is a challenging dataset consisting of 101 categories of food images, with each category containing 1,000 images. It serves as an excellent benchmark for image classification tasks in the context of food recognition.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or TensorFlow-GPU for GPU acceleration)
- EfficientNet TensorFlow implementation (usually available within TensorFlow)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other necessary libraries (install via `pip` or `conda` as needed)
